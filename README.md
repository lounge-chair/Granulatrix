# GrainField-5000
## Overview
GrainField-5000 is a hardware granular sampler with randomization features. It is intended as a musical exploration tool, such that you can record in a sound and “dissect” it by controlling the grain start position and frequency. It leverages two potentiometers as the main control method, giving the user tactile control such that they can focus on the sound produced, instead of waste time fiddling with complicated controls.

## Features
1. Record 5.25 seconds of sound at 48kHz, stored in external SRAM.
2. Crossfading grains ensure continuous, smooth sound without pops, and classic “glitchy” textures at very small grain sizes.
3. Choose grain repeat frequency from 0.5 Hz to 150 Hz.
4. Two smoothed potentiometers allow for tactile control of the parameters.
5. Controlled randomization of grain start position and repeat frequency allows for anywhere between wild cacophonous sound and microscale smearing.
6. Smoothing disable mode to use electromagnetic interference for musical discovery!
7. LCD shows mode information/current status.
